# Realms of the Haunting Map Viewer

https://avchally.github.io/roth-map-viewer/

A site to view the map wireframes from the 1996 FPS adventure game Realms of the Haunting. 

This site uses .OBJ files which were extracted from the game's .RAW files (using tools from [OpenRoth](https://github.com/OpenROTH/tools/blob/master/python/raw/raw_parser.py)).

Future plans include being able to map textures and have item locations available.
